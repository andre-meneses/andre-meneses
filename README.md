### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
My name is AndrÃ© and I am a computer engineering undergrad at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN).I am an extremely curious person and I enjoy learning about the underlying principles upon which technologies are built. Currently, I am doing research on Machine Learning Models on first-break picking, an important task in seismic signals processing. 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a researcher at UFRN.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about **deep learning models** in seismic processing. 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science and machine learning projects.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about computer science and mathematics. 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: andre.meneses.110@ufrn.edu.br
